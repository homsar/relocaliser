## Playing on Twitter

When a game starts, [@relocaliser](https://twitter.com/relocaliser) posts a
recursively translated game name. You play by replying to the most recent one
of these with what you think the actual game name is. If you are correct, your
answer will be retweeted and a new game will start.

Answers are case-insensitive, but punctuation must be correct. Game names are
taken from [Giant Bomb](http://www.giantbomb.com), so if you're struggling with
what variation of the name of a game to use, consult their database.
